•	 A key point from the retiring titles table and the mentorship eligibility table is most of the employees that are eligible to mentor are also the leading titles for retirement.

•	The relation between the retiring titles table and mentorship eligibility table raises a possible leadership problem which could hinder workplace culture and company core values.  
 
•	According to the retiring chart table it appears the more administrative roles have low retiring numbers which is good for continuity and keeping archival information which is key for a company to maintain. 

•	The main number of retiring titles are in the technical fields. This can cause issues with having quality work and meeting deadlines. 

## Summary

### Total Employee by Title Table

Using the total employee count by title I created and the retiring titles table I checked the percentage of employees by title that will be retiring. The percentage of total employees that can retire are Engineer 12%, Staff 11%, Senior Engineer 30%, Senior Staff 30%, Technical Leader 30%, Assistant Engineer 12%, Manager 8%. 
This shows that although technical leaders according to the retiring titles table are near the bottom, they are still losing 30% of their total staff due to retirement. 
Engineers have one of the lowest percentage of employees retiring compared to total employee numbers. This can help with filling Senior Engineering roles that have vaccancies at a higher rate.
